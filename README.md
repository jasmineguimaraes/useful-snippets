# Useful snippets:

Here's a few useful snippets I encounter during my programming journey, a few might be too obvious for a lot of people but this also works as a reminder for me, feel free to enjoy it. :sparkles:



## Internet explorer or Edge incompatibilities?

While web-developing you may encounter problems with CSS3 on IE or Edge, but this will probably save your life:

```
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
```

put it inside your ```<head>``` at the beginning of your HTML.
